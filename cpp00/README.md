# CPP Module 00

This repository contains my solutions and discussion for the CPP Module 00 exercises. The purpose of these exercices is to introduce us to the fundamental concepts of C++ programming (OOP), including classes, objects, member functions, static members, and basic inheritance.

## Overview

CPP Module 00 focuses on the basics of C++ object-oriented programming. The exercises are structured to build a strong foundation in C++ syntax and OOP principles.

### Exercises:

- **Ex00: Megaphone**
  - A simple program that takes strings as arguments, capitalizes them, and outputs them in a loud format.
- **Ex01: My Awesome PhoneBook**
  - An implementation of a basic phone book application that allows adding, searching, and displaying contacts. This is my personal favourite.
- **Ex02: The Job of Your Dreams**
  - A simulation of a banking application using the `Account` class to manage bank accounts, perform deposits, withdrawals, and display account information.

## Getting Started

Before starting the C++ modules, I highly recommend every students to document first. It is fundamental to understand the basics of the C++ language, otherwise you won't be able to write anything (I tried already!)
There's a lot of good lessons on the internet and on YouTube. You just have to find which ones are more suitable for you!
Good luck :)
